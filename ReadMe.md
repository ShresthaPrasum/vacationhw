# WhackaMole Game : A simple JavaScript reflex action game

# The project was initially created as the vacation hw of the web designing subject. This website had HOW TO PRESENT A PRESENTATION tips, and tricks cause that time I didn't know anything except some HTML and CSS. When I showed the project in front of my class, my teacher told me the project was not good enough. So I thought of learning HTML, CSS, and JS. Then I planned to create a Game Hub website with many types of games in it.
